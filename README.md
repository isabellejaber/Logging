# Logging

ASSIGNMENT FOR BRAINSTATION

**DISCLAIMER: 

I ran all of these files in PyCharm on my local MacOS machine.
python3.8 would not support the modules imported from "cryptography", so I used the python3.10 interpreter to run it.
**


CONTENTS:
- encryptDecryptApplication.py
	Contains the encryption, decryption, and key derivation methods provided in the assignment.
	Logging also contained in this file
		Logs write to logs.log
- errorChecker.py
	Tries to run the command required to run encryptDecryptApplication.py
	If there is no error, it returns the output
	If there is an error, it is captured and stored
	    A log containing the captured error is written to the logs.log file
- logs.log
	Stores logs generated by encryptDecryptApplication.py and errorChecker.py


How to run:
python3 errorChecker.py
	This will ask for the mode, plaintext, and key to be inputted separately
		(Yay, for user experience!)


If there are no errors in the console, the encrypted or decrypted result will be displayed in the console and in the logs
If there are errors, these will also appear both in the console and in the logs.
Mostly error and info logs were used, but I explain what the other types of logs are to prove my understanding of the material.

Commands:
*For the purposes of this assignment, I did not code it to wipe the previous logs.log file in the main() function*
**Any other commands you run will appear at the bottom of the existing log file, unless you edit and delete the contents beforehand yourself**
***The logs.log file contained in this folder holds the logs produced by the following values***

	1.
	    Mode: encrypt
	    Plaintext: hello world
